## What is this?

This project showcases a **frontend-only CRUD UI generator** built with **TypeScript and Next.js**.

The generator takes a simple entity schema and produces:
- TypeScript types
- Predictable mock data
- A List screen
- A Form screen

This repository is **not the generator itself**.  
It is a **public showcase** with examples of the generated output and an explanation of how the tool works.

## Why this exists

Building CRUD UIs is repetitive and time-consuming, especially for:
- internal business systems
- admin panels
- backoffice tools

This generator focuses on removing **boring frontend repetition**, without:
- backend generation
- databases
- authentication
- hidden abstractions
- AI guesses

> It removes repetitive UI work.  
> It does not replace thinking.

---

## How it works (conceptually)
Entity Schema → Code Generators → Files → ZIP


- The schema is the single source of truth
- Generators are pure functions
- Output is plain React + TypeScript code

The generated code is:
- readable
- deterministic
- easy to customize
- suitable for real projects

---

## Example generated output

Below is an example of files generated for a `Customer` entity.

examples/customer/
├─ customer.types.ts
├─ customer.mock.ts
├─ CustomerList.tsx
└─ CustomerForm.tsx


These files are **generated by the tool** and can be copied directly into a React or Next.js project.

---

## Example: TypeScript entity

```ts
export interface Customer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  status?: "active" | "inactive";
}

Example: List screen (simplified)

export function CustomerList() {
  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>id</th>
          <th>name</th>
          <th>email</th>
          <th>status</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {/* rows */}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
}
```
Example: Form screen (simplified)
```ts
export function CustomerForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input name="name" />
      <input name="email" type="email" />
      <select name="status">
        <option value="active">active</option>
        <option value="inactive">inactive</option>
      </select>
    </form>
  );
}
```ts
What this tool does NOT do

This generator intentionally does not:

create backend code

generate APIs or databases

handle authentication or permissions

act as a framework or low-code platform

It generates plain frontend code that you own and control.
It generates plain frontend code that you own and control.

Who this is for

React / Next.js developers

Freelancers building internal tools

CRUD-heavy admin interfaces

Teams that want consistent frontend structure
